<h1>Welcome/ Malo Leilei/Talofa/Nau Mai/Aloha.</h1>
<h2>My name is Genesis Hautau. I am Tongan and Samoan. I will be talking about how i would
	want to make a program where all polynesian girls come together and to make friends.
This afterschool program will also help girls to learn how to respect others, conquer
your fears, brave, and e.t.c.</h2>

<div class="copy" style="font-weight: bold;">
	<p> This website is about how i want to bring polynesian girls come together and be friends and to  make a afterschool program
		because there are a lot of good afterschool programs with different kind of
		girls but there are no polynesian girls who wants to participate. I would call this afterschool program "Teine Lalelei"</p>

	<p> I would provide  things that we polynesians like to eat or they would like to eat things they would want to eat and things to
		do like dancing and playing an instruament. We would also play games too. The girls
		would choose what they would want to do.</p>

	<p> Making a afterschool prgram for polynesian girls because there are a lot
	of afterschool programs that a lot of polynesian don't go to and not participate
in and to learn about there culture and even do homework and relax.</p>

	<p> The program will start out like; you would come in and you just hang out. Then, we
		would start like how was your day and we would talk about things in our life in the futre and other things.
		After that, we would start homework and after homework, we would just hang
		out or go outside.Spaeckers and other helpers would come and get a lesson or a class that are fun like art,cooking,book clubs and others.</p>

	<p> The age of girls that are allowed to come is 6-15 years old.The snacks there
		would be healthy and we would take field trips. In the summer, you can also
		come for summer programs and you would come back and we would go swimming, take history lessons to places, and other things.</p>

	<p> The tuition is going to be $124 but for the first day is going to be free and
		you would meet the girls and talk to each other. Parents would come and pick
		them up at 5pm. They would drop them off at 3pm but they can come early.
	</p>

	<p> I would actually make this afterschool program and go to it and to be with
		other girls. I don't know where this afterschool program will be but this will
		be a good experience for girls to meet other girls there age. It would be big.
		There would be 4 staff because the girls will be in different age groups.</p>
